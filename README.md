##  Introduction

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to fetch **real-time weather data** from an online API and visualize it through graphs. Weather forecasting and monitoring play a vital role in our daily lives, agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. The purpose of this project is to show how simple code can connect with an API, extract useful information such as temperature, and represent it visually in the form of a bar chart.

In this project, we specifically track the **current temperature of five major Indian cities** – Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bangalore – using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The output is presented as a **bar chart** which provides a quick comparison of the temperatures across cities.



 Tools and Technologies Used

1. **Programming Language: Python**
   Python was chosen because of its simplicity, readability, and the large collection of libraries available for data handling and visualization.

2. **Editor / IDE: Python IDLE & VS Code**
   The project was developed and executed using **Python IDLE** for simplicity, and it can also be run in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, which provides better debugging and version control support.

3. **Libraries Used**

   * **Requests**: To make HTTP requests and fetch live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
   * **Matplotlib**: To plot the temperatures of cities in a bar chart.
   * **JSON (built-in in Python)**: To parse and extract specific values such as temperature from the API response.

4. **Platform: OpenWeatherMap API**
   OpenWeatherMap provides free and paid APIs for current weather data, forecasts, and historical climate records. We used the **Current Weather Data API** with an API key to fetch live temperature data for multiple cities.



##  Project Workflow

1. **API Key Setup**
   An API key was generated by registering on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). This key is used to authenticate requests.

2. **Fetching Weather Data**

   * The program creates a list of cities (`["Mumbai", "Delhi", "Chennai", "Kolkata", "Bangalore"]`).
   * For each city, it sends a request to the API endpoint.
   * The response is returned in **JSON format** which contains temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
   * From the response, only the **temperature** is extracted.

3. **Storing the Data**
   The extracted temperatures are stored in a list (`temps[]`). If a request fails, a default value (`0`) is stored to avoid errors in visualization.

4. **Data Visualization**
   Using **Matplotlib**, the program plots a bar chart where:

   * X-axis represents the city names
   * Y-axis represents their respective temperatures in Celsius
   * The chart uses color formatting and gridlines for better readability

##  Example Output

When executed, the program displays both **terminal output** and a **graphical bar chart**.

**Sample Terminal Output:**


Mumbai: 30°C  
Delhi: 35°C  
Chennai: 32°C  
Kolkata: 31°C  
Bangalore: 28°C  


**Graph Output:**
A bar chart where each bar represents a city’s current temperature.



##  Applications

This project has several practical applications:

1. **Weather Monitoring Dashboards** – Can be extended to include multiple cities worldwide.
2. **Travel Planning Apps** – Helps users compare weather conditions in different places.
3. **Agricultural Planning** – Farmers can monitor climatic conditions for better decision-making.
4. **Disaster Management** – Tracking extreme temperatures can help in early warnings.
5. **Education & Learning** – Acts as a beginner-friendly project to understand APIs and data visualization.




##  Conclusion

The **Weather Data Visualization Project** successfully demonstrates how to integrate Python with real-world data using APIs. By combining **Requests** for fetching data and **Matplotlib** for visualization, this project provides an easy yet powerful way to analyze weather conditions across multiple locations.

It not only highlights the use of Python in data science and analytics but also shows how such small projects can have real-life importance in daily applications, ranging from weather dashboards to decision-making systems.
